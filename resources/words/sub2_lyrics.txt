Daddy Lessons

Yee-haw
Oh, oh, oh
Texas, texas (oh, oh, oh) texas

Came into this world
Daddy's little girl
And daddy made a soldier out of me
Oh, oh, oh
Daddy made me dance
And daddy held my hand
Oh, oh, oh
And daddy liked his whisky with his tea
And we rode motorcycles
Blackjack, classic vinyl
Tough girl is what I had to be

He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
Oh, and that's when he gave to me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh

Daddy made me fight
It wasn't always right
But he said girl it's your second amendment
He always played it cool
But daddy was no fool
And right before he died he said remember

He said take care of your mother
Watch out for your sister
And that's when daddy looked at me

With his gun, with his head held high
He told me not to cry
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
With his right hand on his rifle
He swore it on the bible
My daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
He held me in his arms
And he taught me to be strong
He told me when he's gone
Here's what you do
When trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
My daddy warned me about men like you
He said baby girl he's playing you
He's playing you
Cause when trouble comes in town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Cause when trouble comes to town
And men like me come around
Oh, my daddy said shoot
Oh, my daddy said shoot
(Good job Bey, hahaha)

Pretty Hurts

Miss Third Wards, your first question
What is your aspiration in life?
Oh My aspiration in life
Would be to be happy

Mama said, you're a pretty girl
What's in your head it doesn't matter
Brush your hair, fix your teeth
What you wear is all that matters

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

Blonder hair, flat chest
Tv says bigger is better
South Beach, sugar free
Vogue says
Thinner is better

Just another stage
Pageant the pain away
This time I'm gonna take the crown
Without falling down, down

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery



Ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away
The pain's inside
And nobody frees you from your body
It's the soul that needs surgery
It's my soul that needs surgery
Plastic smiles and denial
Can only take you so far
And you break
When the paper sign leaves you in the dark
You left a shattered mirror
And the shards of a beautiful girl

Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Perfection is the disease of a nation
Pretty hurts
We shine the light on whatever's worse
Tryna fix something
But you can't fix what you can't see
It's the soul that needs the surgery

When you'r alone all by yourself
And you're lying in your bed
Reflection stares right into you
Are you happy with yourself?
It's just a way to masquerade
The illusion has been shed
Are you happy with yourself?
Are you happy with yourself?
Yes


Ain't Your Mama

[Chorus]
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama

Society

Oh, it's a mystery to me
We have a greed with which we have agreed
And you think you have to want more than you need
Until you have it all you won't be free

Society, you're a crazy breed
Hope you're not lonely without me...

When you want more than you have
You think you need...
And when you think more than you want
Your thoughts begin to bleed
I think I need to find a bigger place
Because when you have more than you think
You need more space

Society, you're a crazy breed
Hope you're not lonely without me...
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me...

There's those thinking, more is less, less is more
But if less is more, how you keeping score?
Means for every point you make, your level drops
Kinda like you're starting from the top
You can't do that...

Society, you're a crazy breed
Hope you're not lonely without me...
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me...

Society, have mercy on me
Hope you're not angry if I disagree...
Society, crazy indeed
Hope you're not lonely without me...


Dear Mr. President

Dear Mr. President
Come take a walk with me
Let's pretend we're just two people and
You're not better than me
I'd like to ask you some questions
If we can speak honestly

What do you feel
When you see all the homeless on the street?
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep?
What do you feel when you look in the mirror?
Are you proud?

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream
When a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye
And tell me why

Dear Mr. President
Were you a lonely boy?
Are you a lonely boy?
How can you say
No child is left behind
We're not dumb and we're not blind
They're all sitting in your cells
While you pay the road to hell

What kind of father
Would take his own daughter's rights away?
And what kind of father
Might hate his own daughter if she were gay?
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine

How do you sleep while the rest of us cry?
How do you dream
When a mother has no chance to say goodbye?
How do you walk with your head held high?
Can you even look me in the eye

Let me tell you about hard work
Minimum wage with a baby on the way
Let me tell you about hard work
Rebuilding your house
After the bombs took them away
Let me tell you about hard work
Building a bed out of a cardboard box
Let me tell you about hard work
Hard work
Hard work
You don't know nothing about hard work
Hard work
Hard work
Oh

How do you sleep at night
How do you walk with your head held high
Dear Mr. President
You'd never take a walk with me
Would you?


Hard Out Here

I suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinking
You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen
I won't be bragging about my cars
Or talking 'bout my chains
Don't need to shake my ass for you
'Cause I've got a brain

If I told you about my sex life
You call me a slut
Them boys be talking 'bout their bitches
No one's making a fuss
There's a glass ceiling to break
Uh hu, there's money to make
And now it's time to speed it up
'Cause I can't move at this pace

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here

For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here
For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here

If you're not a size six
And you're not good looking
Well, you better be rich
Or be real good at cooking
You should probably lose some weight
'Cause we can't see your bones
You should probably fix your face
Or you'll end up on your own

Don't you want to have somebody
Who objectifies you
Have you thought about you butt
Who's gonna tear in in two
We've never had it so good
Uh hu, we're out of the woods
And if you can't detect the sarcasm
You've misunderstood

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here

For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here
For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here

(bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch, bitch, bitch)
(bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch, bitch, bitch)
(bad bitch, bad bitch, bad bitch, bitch, bitch)

Inequality promises
That it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice
'Cause it's not going away

Inequality promises
That it's here to stay
Always trust the injustice
'Cause it's not going away

Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say
I'll go ahead and say them anyway
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out here

For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here
For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here

Bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here
For a bitch it's hard
(for a bitch, for a bitch)
For a bitch it's hard
It's hard out here

Fall In Line

Little girls, listen closely
'Cause no one told me
But you deserve to know
That in this world, you are not beholden
You do not owe them
Your body and your soul

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl
is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
Maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I wasn't made to fall in line, no

Show some skin, make him want you
'Cause God forbid you
Know your own way home
And ask yourself why it matters
Who it flatters
You're more than flesh and bones

All the youth in the world will not save you from growing older
And all the truth in a girl
is too precious to be stolen from her

It's just the way it is
Maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
I wasn't made to fall in line
No, no, I wasn't made to fall in line
No, I weren't made to fall in line, oh

1, 2, 3
Right - 2, 3
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March - 2, 3
1, 2, 3
Who told you you're allowed to think?

1, 2, 3
Right - 2, 3
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March - 2, 3
1, 2, 3
Who told you you're allowed to think?

It's just the way it is
Maybe it's never gonna change
But I got a mind to show my strength
And I got a right to speak my mind
And I'm gonna pay for this
They're gonna burn me at the stake
But I got a fire in my veins
'Cause I wasn't made to fall in line
I wasn't made to leave my fate
I'm never gonna fall in line, oh

1, 2, 3
Right - 2, 3
Shut your mouth
Stick your ass out for me
March - 2, 3
1, 2, 3
Who told you you're allowed to think?
