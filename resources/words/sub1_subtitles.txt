If you were to lay your digestive tract
out in a straight line,

it would form a tube
spanning nearly ten meters.

The last 1.5 meters of that
are called the colon, or large intestine.

Cells in this organ's lining
constantly renew themselves,

but the genes that moderate this process
occasionally go awry,

leading to the excessive growth
of new cells.
That results in small growths
or abnormal clumps of cells called polyps.

The majority of these polyps
won't do any harm,

but some can become cancerous
when their cells begin to grow

and divide rapidly,

projecting further into the colon.
At that point, they can transform
into colon cancer,

one of the most prevalent and
preventable forms of cancer in the world.

That's a slow process:

though growth times vary,

it often takes around ten years
for a small polyp

to grow and develop into a cancerous one.

We don't know exactly what causes

the majority of colon polyps
and colon cancers.

We do know in general that colon cancer
involves the activation

of what's called oncogenes in the polyp,

and/or the loss of tumor-suppressor genes
that usually keep cancer cells in check.

Most cells have proto-oncogenes
that help them grow.
When a proto-oncogene mutates,
or there are two many copies of it,

it can become a permanently
active oncogene

with cells that grow out of control.

While we don't yet know exactly what
underlying factors cause these changes,

experts suspect a combination
of both environmental
and inherited genetic factors.

In the worst cases, when cells within
polyps divide and spread unchecked,

they eventually break through
the lining of the colon.
Lymph and blood vessels carry
those cells all over the body,

and they can go on to form tumors.

Despite these challenges,
there's a solution.

We've become extremely good at
detecting and removing offending polyps

before they can cause cancer.
This happens through a process
called screening,

and when we do it regularly,
we can prevent many cases of colon cancer.

So, who's at risk?
Most cases occur in people
aged 50 years or older.

This group is considered at average risk
for colon cancer or colon polyps.

There's also a higher risk group
that includes people with personal

or family histories
of colon polyps or cancer,

and those who suffer
from inherited genetic syndromes,

or inflammatory diseases,

like Crohn’s disease
and ulcerative colitis.

So the best age to initiate screening
varies from person to person.

If you have access to healthcare,

it's best to consult a doctor
to find out when you should begin.

Screening can be done with various tests.

Colonoscopy involves
a long, thin, flexible tube

that's fitted with a video camera
and light at the end

and placed internally to examine
the colon for polyps.

If polyps are found, a doctor
can do a polypectomy,

a procedure that removes polyps
from the colonic wall.

Doctors can also then test
the polyp for cancerous cells.

Colonoscopy is the only test that can
be used to both find and remove polyps.

There are, however,
other useful screening tests,

including imaging

and at-home tests that can allow patients

to examine their stool
for small amounts of blood.

Occasionally, polyps are too large
to be removed during a colonoscopy,

in which case, the next step is surgery.

If blood and imaging tests then reveal

that cancerous cells
have spread outside the colon,

then a special treatment,
like chemotherapy,

may also be required to stop
the cancer from escalating.

We can also take on certain habits

to reduce our likelihood of developing
colon cancer in the first place.

There's evidence that maintaining
a healthy weight,

not smoking,

and being physically active can help.

But most importantly,
access to healthcare

and regular screenings
at crucial times in life

are the best ways to prevent colon cancer.

﻿With his harebrained schemes
and asinine dealings with the gods,

King Midas ruled the ancient kingdom
of Phrygia with an uneven hand.
He was known in Greek mythology
as a rogue ruler

whose antics bemused his people
and distracted the gods.

Midas spent his days
in a stupor of splendor,

spoiling himself and his beloved daughter
and gorging himself on feasts and wine.

Unsurprisingly, he felt
an affinity with Dionysus,

god of wine, carnival, and performance.
One day, Midas discovered a satyr

dozing in his rose garden and drunk
on more than the scent of flowers.

Midas recognized the satyr
as one of Dionysus’s followers

and let him nurse
his hangover at the palace.

Pleased with the king’s hospitality,
Dionysus offered to grant him one wish.

Midas cast a greedy eye
over his surroundings.

Despite the luxury in which he lived,

no amount of precious jewels, finest silk
or splendid decor felt like enough.

His life, he thought, was lacking luster;
what he needed was more gold.
The god sent the power to turn anything
the king touched to gold

surging through Midas.

Ecstatic, he turned to his possessions.

At his lightest touch,
the palace walls transformed,

stone statues shone,

and goblets glittered.

He galloped through his home in a frenzy,

handling each item until
it took on a lustrous sheen.

Soon the palace heaved with gold,

and Midas’s delirious
laughter echoed off the walls.

Exhausted and hungry from his rampage,

Midas picked up a bunch of grapes from
his newly gilded fruit bowl.

But he nearly shattered his teeth,

for the fruit had turned
to metal in his mouth.

When he picked up a loaf of bread,
the crumbs hardened in his hand.

Flinging himself onto
his bed in frustration,

Midas discovered his plush pillows
had morphed into solid gold.

Hearing his cries of frustration,
his daughter entered the room.

But when Midas reached out to her,

he saw with horror that he had frozen her
into a golden statue.

Horrified at what he had done,

Midas begged the gods
to rid him of his power.
Taking pity on the foolish king,

Dionysus told Midas to wash
his hands in the River Pactolus.

When Midas reached into the river,
the gold drained from his fingertips.
Midas returned home
to find his daughter alive

and his palace back to normal,
and he rejoiced.

You’d think he would’ve learned
his lesson,
but just a few weeks later,
Midas blundered again,

insulting the music and sun god Apollo
when he declared Pan a greater musician.

Apollo scornfully declared that the king
must have the ears of an ass
to make such a misjudgment,
and transformed Midas accordingly.

Once again regretting his behavior,

Midas kept his hairy ears
hidden in public.
They were seen only by his barber,

who was sworn to secrecy during
a very awkward grooming session.

The barber stifled his laughter
and fought the desire to tell someone,

yet the secret consumed him.

One day, he walked outside the city
and dug a hole in the ground.

Plunging his head into the earth,
the desperate barber whispered,
“Midas has ass’s ears.”

Soon after, a clump of reeds sprang up

in the spot where the barber
had buried his words.
When the wind blew, they carried the
echoes of his whisper through the breeze:

"Midas has ass’s ears."

At the sound, donkeys in the fields raised
their heads in recognition
and people chuckled to themselves
at the follies of their king.

With his golden touch and ass’s ears,
Midas was not the most respected ruler.

And where other leaders were honored
through statues and temples,

his people remembered him
a little differently:
in the depths of the glittering river
and the rustle of the Phrygian wind.

﻿In the deserts of the American Southwest,

spadefoot toad tadpoles
hatch in tiny oases.

Until they develop into toadlets,
they can’t survive outside of water,

but these ponds are transient
and quickly evaporate.

The tadpoles are
in a race against the clock
to grow up before
their nurseries disappear.

So nearly overnight,
some of the brood explode in size.

They use their jack-o-lantern teeth
and huge jaw muscles

to devour their smaller pond mates.

Nourished by this extra fuel,

they develop quicker,
leaving the pond before it can dry out.

The spadefoot toad
is far from the only animal

to eat members of its own species
as a normal part of its life cycle.

All of these animals do.

If that surprises you,
you’re in good company.

Until recently, scientists
thought cannibalism

was a rare response to starvation
or other extreme stress.

Well-known cannibals,

like the praying mantis
and black widow spider,

were considered bizarre exceptions.

But now, we know they more
or less represent the rule.

While it may seem counterproductive

for members of the same species
to eat each other,

cannibalism can promote the survival
of the species as a whole
by reducing competition,

culling the weak,

and bolstering the strong.

Some species, like the spadefoot toad,

cannibalize in response
to environmental pressures.

Their situation is precarious,

but cannibalism for them isn’t
a last-ditch attempt to avoid starvation.

Rather, it’s a way to more quickly
outgrow a stage

where they’re especially vulnerable
to predation

or dangerous environmental conditions.

Other species, including many fish,

indiscriminately cannibalize each other
during foraging behavior.

Fish produce large numbers of tiny young,

and adults exhibit about as much
individual recognition of their offspring

as humans do for a handful of raisins.

Fish eggs, larvae, and juveniles
are easily available, nutrient-rich meals,

and with thousands of eggs in a clutch,

plenty are still available to hatch
after the adults have snacked.

Baby fish aren’t just at risk of being
cannibalized by adults—
siblings eat each other too.

Sand tiger shark eggs develop and hatch

inside their mother’s oviducts
at different times.

When the hatchlings run out of yolk
from their own eggs,

they eat the other eggs and hatchlings
until one baby shark
from each oviduct remains.

When they emerge, the young sharks
are well-nourished, experienced predators

who stand a better chance of surviving.

Even when they aren’t consumed
for nutrition,

young animals are especially
vulnerable to cannibalism.

Hamsters,
rats,

and other rodent mothers

will eat some of their young
if they’re sick,

dead,

or simply too numerous to feed.
In other mammals,
including bears and lions,

males will kill offspring
sired by another.

That’s because childless females become
receptive to mating more quickly

than if they were caring for a cub.

Rather than waste nutritious meat,
the males then eat the dead cubs.

Meanwhile, cannibalism is less common
in birds than in other groups,

but certain species will eat diseased
or dead hatchlings

as a way of disposing of the
bodies before they can attract maggots.

When adults eat each other, males are
cannibalized more often than females,

usually during mating
and generally because they’re smaller.

Male Australian redback spiders
mate with much larger females.

Rather than scrambling away after mating,
the tiny male does a somersault,

bringing his abdomen into contact
with his mate’s mouthparts.

The female showers him with enzyme-rich
gut juice and consumes his abdomen.

Males not killed in the initial mating
crawl back into the fray,

often half-eaten,
to mate again, after which they’re
dispatched to the spider pantry.

So not only does the male provide
the female with his sperm,
but he also provides her with
a nutritious meal

to better ensure that she’ll
survive to pass on his genes.

All in all, it’s clear
that cannibalism is

as much a part of life
in the animal kingdom

as other, better-recognized behaviors.

As we sink our teeth into the evidence
of cannibalism in nature,
we might ask ourselves,

what else have we missed by applying
human standards to the natural world?

﻿Curiosity:

a blessing, or a curse?

The paradoxical nature of this trait

was personified for the ancient Greeks

in the mythical figure of Pandora.

According to legend,

she was the first mortal woman,
whose blazing curiosity set a chain
of earth-shattering events in motion.

Pandora was breathed into being
by Hephaestus, God of fire,

who enlisted the help of his divine
companions to make her extraordinary.
From Aphrodite she received the capacity
for deep emotion;

from Hermes she gained
mastery over language.

Athena gave the gift of fine craftsmanship
and attention to detail,

and Hermes gave her her name.

Finally, Zeus bestowed
two gifts on Pandora.

The first was the trait of curiosity,

which settled in her spirit and sent
her eagerly out into the world.

The second was a heavy box, ornately
curved, heavy to hold –

and screwed tightly shut.

But the contents, Zeus told her,
were not for mortal eyes.

She was not to open the box
under any circumstance.
On earth, Pandora met and fell in love
with Epimetheus, a talented titan

who had been given the task
of designing the natural world by Zeus.

He had worked alongside
his brother Prometheus,

who created the first humans

but was eternally punished
for giving them fire.

Epimetheus missed his brother desperately,

but in Pandora he found another
fiery-hearted soul for companionship.

Pandora brimmed with excitement
at life on earth.

She was also easily distracted
and could be impatient,
given her thirst for knowledge and desire
to question her surroundings.

Often, her mind wandered to the contents
of the sealed box.

What treasure was so great it could never
be seen by human eyes,

and why was it in her care?

Her fingers itched to pry it open.

Sometimes she was convinced
she heard voices whispering

and the contents rattling around inside,

as if straining to be free.

Its enigma became maddening.

Over time, Pandora became more and more
obsessed with the box.
It seemed there was a force beyond her
control that drew her to the contents,

which echoed her name louder and louder.

One day she could bear it no longer.

Stealing away from Epimetheus,

she stared at the mystifying box.

She’d take one glance inside,

then be able to rid
her mind of it forever...

But at the first crack of the lid,
the box burst open.

Monstrous creatures and horrendous sounds

rushed out in a cloud of smoke and swirled
around her, screeching and cackling.

Filled with terror,
Pandora clawed desperately at the air
to direct them back into their prison.

But the creatures surged out
in a gruesome cloud.

She felt a wave of foreboding
as they billowed away.

Zeus had used the box as a vessel
for all the forces of evil
and suffering he’d created –

and once released,

they were uncontainable.

As she wept,

Pandora became aware of a sound echoing
from within the box.

This was not the eerie
whispering of demons,

but a light tinkling that seemed
to ease her anguish.

When she once again lifted
the lid and peered in,
a warm beam of light rose out
and fluttered away.

As she watched it flickering in the wake
of the evil she’d unleashed,

Pandora’s pain was eased.

She knew that opening the box
was irreversible –

but alongside the strife, she’d set hope
forth to temper its effects.

Today, Pandora’s Box suggests
the extreme consequences

of tampering with the unknown –
but Pandora’s burning curiosity also
suggests the duality that lies

at the heart of human inquiry.

Are we bound to investigate everything
we don’t know,
to mine the earth for more –

or are there some mysteries

that are better left unsolved?

﻿Each time you take a step,

200 muscles work in unison
to lift your foot,
propel it forward,

and set it down.

It's just one of the many thousands
of tasks performed by the muscular system.

This network of over 650 muscles
covers the body

and is the reason we can blink,
smile,

run,

jump,
and stand upright.

It's even responsible for
the heart's dependable thump.

First, what exactly
is the muscular system?

It's made up of three main muscle types:

skeletal muscle, which attaches
via tendons to our bones,
cardiac muscle, which is only
found in the heart,

and smooth muscle, which lines
the blood vessels and certain organs,

like the intestine and uterus.

All three types are
made up of muscle cells,

also known as fibers,
bundled tightly together.

These bundles receive signals from
the nervous system

that contract the fibers, which in turn
generates force and motion.

This produces almost all
the movements we make.

Some of the only parts of the body
whose motions aren't governed
by the muscular system

are sperm cells,

the hair-like cilia in our airways,
and certain white blood cells.

Muscle contraction can be split
into three main types.

The first two, shortening muscle fibers
and lengthening them,

generate opposing forces.

So the biceps will shorten
while the triceps will lengthen or relax,

pulling up the arm and making it
bend at the elbow.

This allows us to, say, pick up a book,

or if the muscle relationship
is reversed, put it down.

This complementary partnership
exists throughout the muscular system.

The third type of contraction
creates a stabilizing force.

In these cases, the muscle fibers
don't change in length,

but instead keep the muscles rigid.

This allows us to grip a mug of coffee
or lean against a wall.

It also maintains our posture
by holding us upright.

Skeletal muscles form the bulk
of the muscular system,

make up about 30-40% of the body's weight,

and generate most of its motion.

Some muscles are familiar to us,
like the pectorals and the biceps.

Others may be less so,
like the buccinator,

a muscle that attaches your cheek
to your teeth,

or the body's tiniest skeletal muscle,

a one-millimeter-long tissue fragment
called the stapedius

that's nestled deep inside the ear.

Wherever they occur, skeletal muscles are
connected to the somatic nervous system,

which gives us almost complete control
over their movements.

This muscle group also contains
two types of muscle fibers

to refine our motions even further,
slow-twitch and fast-twitch.

Fast-twitch fibers react instantly
when triggered
but quickly use up their energy
and tire out.

Slow-twitch fibers, on the other hand,
are endurance cells.
They react and use energy slowly
so they can work for longer periods.

A sprinter will accumulate more
fast-twitch muscles in her legs

through continuous practice,
enabling her to quickly, if briefly,
pick up the pace,

whereas back muscles contain
more slow-twitch muscles

to maintain your posture all day.

Unlike the skeletal muscles, the body's
cardiac and smooth muscles

are managed by
the autonomic nervous system
beyond our direct control.

That makes your heart thump
roughly 3 billion times

over the course of your life,
which supplies the body
with blood and oxygen.

Autonomic control also contracts
and relaxes smooth muscle

in a rhythmic cycle.

That pumps blood through the smooth
internal walls of blood vessels,

enables the intestine to constrict and
push food through the digestive system,

and allows the uterus to contract
when a person is giving birth.

As muscles work, they also use energy
and produce an important byproduct, heat.

In fact, muscle provides
about 85% of your warmth,
which the heart and blood vessels
then spread evenly across the body

via the blood.
Without that, we couldn't maintain
the temperature necessary

for our survival.

The muscular system
may be largely invisible to us,

but it leaves its mark on almost
everything we do,

whether it's the blink of an eye
or a race to the finish line.

﻿Over the course of our lifetimes,

our bodies undergo a series
of extraordinary metamorphoses:
we grow,

experience puberty,
and many of us reproduce.

Behind the scenes,

the endocrine system works
constantly to orchestrate these changes.

Alongside growth and sexual maturity,

this system regulates everything
from your sleep

to the rhythm of your beating heart,
exerting its influence over each
and every one of your cells.

The endocrine system relies
on interactions

between three features to do its job:

glands,

hormones,

and trillions of cell receptors.
Firstly, there are several
hormone-producing glands:

three in your brain,
and seven in the rest of your body.

Each is surrounded by
a network of blood vessels,

from which they extract ingredients
to manufacture dozens of hormones.

Those hormones are then
pumped out in tiny amounts,

usually into the bloodstream.

From there, each hormone needs
to locate a set of target cells
in order to bring about a specific change.

To find its targets,
it’s helped along by receptors,

which are special proteins inside
or on the cell’s surface.

Those receptors recognise
specific hormones as they waft by,

and bind to them.

When this happens,

that hormone-receptor combination
triggers a range of effects

that either increase or decrease
specific processes inside the cell

to change the way that cell behaves.

By exposing millions of cells at a time

to hormones
in carefully-regulated quantities,

the endocrine system drives
large-scale changes across the body.

Take, for instance, the thyroid
and the two hormones it produces,
triiodothyronine and thyroxine.

These hormones travel to most
of the body’s cells,

where they influence how quickly
those cells use energy

and how rapidly they work.
In turn, that regulates everything
from breathing rate

to heartbeat,

body temperature,

and digestion.
Hormones also have some of their most
visible—and familiar—effects

during puberty.

In men, puberty begins when
the testes start secreting testosterone.

That triggers the gradual development
of the sexual organs,

makes facial hair sprout,

and causes the voice to deepen

and height to increase.
In women, estrogen secreted from the
ovaries signals the start of adulthood.

It helps the body develop,

makes the hips widen,

and thickens the womb’s lining,
preparing the body
for menstruation or pregnancy.

An enduring misconception around
the endocrine system

is that there are exclusively male
and female hormones.

In fact, men and women
have estrogen and testosterone,

just in different amounts.

Both hormones play a role
in pregnancy, as well,

alongside more than 10 other hormones
that ensure the growth of the fetus,

enable birth,

and help the mother feed her child.

Such periods of hormonal change are also
associated with fluctuations in mood.

That’s because hormones can influence

the production of certain chemicals
in the brain, like serotonin.

When chemical levels shift,
they may cause changes in mood, as well.

But that’s not to say that hormones
have unlimited power over us.

They’re frequently viewed as the main
drivers of our behavior,

making us slaves to their effects,
especially during puberty.

But research shows that our behavior
is collectively shaped

by a variety of influences,

including the brain
and its neurotransmitters,

our hormones,

and various social factors.

The primary function
of the endocrine system

is to regulate our bodily processes,
not control us.

Sometimes disease,

stress,
and even diet can disrupt
that regulatory function, however,

altering the quantity of hormones
that glands secrete
or changing the way that cells respond.

Diabetes is one of the most
common hormonal disorders,

occurring when the pancreas
secretes too little insulin,

a hormone that manages blood sugar levels.

And hypo- and hyperthyroidism

occur when the thyroid gland makes
too little or too much thyroid hormone.

When there’s too little thyroid hormone,
that results in a slowed heart rate,

fatigue,

and depression,

and when there’s too much
thyroid hormone,

weight loss,

sleeplessness,

and irritability.
But most of the time,

the endocrine system manages to keep
our bodies in a state of balance.

And through its constant regulation,

it drives the changes that ultimately
help us become who we are.

﻿You may take them for granted,
but your teeth are a marvel.

They break up all your food
over the course of your life,

while being strong enough
to withstand breakage themselves.

And they’re formed using
only the raw materials

from the food they grind down
in the first place.

What’s behind their impressive strength?

Teeth rely on an ingenious structure
that makes them both hard and tough.

Hardness can be thought of as the ability
to resist a crack from starting,

while toughness is what stops
the crack from spreading

Very few materials have both properties.

For instance, glass is hard but not tough,

while leather is tough but not hard.

Teeth manage both by having two layers:

a hard external cap of enamel, made up
almost entirely of a calcium phosphate,

and beneath it,
a tougher layer of dentin,
partly formed from organic fibers
that make it flexible.

This amazing structure is created
by two types of cells:
ameloblasts that secrete enamel

and odontoblasts that secrete dentin.

As they form teeth,
odontoblasts move inward,
while ameloblasts move out
and slough off when they hit the surface.

For enamel, this process produces long,
thin strands,
each about 60 nanometers in diameter.

That’s one one-thousandth
the width of a human hair.

Those are bundled into rods,
packed together,
tens of thousands per square millimeter,

to form the shield-like enamel layer.

Once this process is finished,
your enamel can’t repair itself again
because all the cells
that make it are lost,

so we’re lucky that enamel
can’t be easily destroyed.

Odontoblasts use a more complex process,
but unlike ameloblasts, they stick around,

continuing to secrete dentin
throughout your life.

Despite the differences in teeth
across the mammalian order,

the underlying process of tooth growth
is the same whether it’s for lions,

kangaroos,

elephants,

or us.

What changes is how nature sculpts
the shape of the tooth,

altering the folding and growth patterns

to suit the distinct diets
of different species.

Cows have flat molar teeth with parallel
ridges for grinding tough grasses.

Cats have sharp crested molars,
like blades, for shearing meat and sinew.

Pigs have blunt, thick ones,
useful for crushing hard roots and seeds.

The myriad molars of modern mammals

can be traced back to a common form
called “tribosphenic,"
which first appeared
during the dinosaur age.

In the 19th Century,
paleontologist Edward Drinker Cope

developed the basic model
for how this form evolved.

He hypothesized that
it started with a cone-like tooth,

as we see in many fishes,
amphibians, and reptiles.

Small cusps were then added,
so the tooth had three in a row,

aligned front to back,
and connected by crests.

Over time, the cusps were pushed out
of line to make triangular crowns.

Adjacent teeth formed a continuous
zigzag of crests for slicing and dicing.

A low shelf then formed
at the back of each set of teeth,

which became a platform for crushing.

As Cope realized, the tribosphenic molar
served as the jumping-off point
for the radiation of specialized
forms to follow,

each shaped by evolutionary needs.

Straighten the crests
and remove the shelf,

and you’ve got the conveniently
bladed teeth of cats and dogs.
Remove the front cusp, raise the shelf,
and you’ve got our human molars.

A few additional tweaks get you
a horse or cow tooth.

Some details in Cope’s intuitive
hypothesis proved wrong.

But in the fossil record,

there are examples of teeth
that look just as he predicted
and we can trace the molars of all living
mammals back to that primitive form.

Today, the ability to consume
diverse forms of food

enables mammals to survive in habitats

ranging from mountain peaks
and ocean depths

to rainforests and deserts.

So the success of our biological class
is due in no small measure

to the remarkable strength
and adaptability

of the humble mammalian molar.

﻿As the warrior slept,

a snake coiled around his face.
Instead of a threat, his wife saw an omen–

a fearsome power that would lead
her husband to either glory or doom.

For now, however, he was only a slave –

one of millions taken from the territories

conquered by Rome to work the mines,

till the fields,

or fight for the crowd’s entertainment.

A nomadic Thracian from
what is now Bulgaria,

he had served in the Roman Army
but was imprisoned for desertion.

His name was Spartacus.

Spartacus had been brought to Capua
by Batiatus, a lanista,

or trainer of gladiators.

And life at the ludus, or gladiator
school, was unforgiving.

New recruits were forced to swear an oath
“to be burned, to be bound, to be beaten,
and to be killed by the sword,”

and to obey their master’s will
without question.

But even harsh discipline couldn’t
break Spartacus’s spirit.

In 73 BCE, Spartacus led 73 other slaves

to seize knives and skewers from the
kitchen and fight their way out,

hijacking a wagon of gladiator equipment
along the way.

They were done fighting for others–

now, they fought for their freedom.
When the news reached Rome,

the Senate was too busy with wars in
Spain and the Pontic Empire

to worry about some unruly slaves.

Unconcerned, praetor Claudius Glaber took
an army of three thousand men

to the rebel’s refuge at Mount Vesuvius,

and blocked off the only passage
up the mountain.

All that remained was to wait and
starve them out–
or so he thought.

In the dead of night,

the rebels lowered themselves down the
cliffside on ropes made from vines,

and flanked Glaber’s unguarded camp.

Thus began the legend of Rome’s
defiant gladiator.

As news of the rebellion spread,

its ranks swelled with escaped slaves,

deserting soldiers, and hungry peasants.

Many were untrained,

but Spartacus’s clever tactics
transformed them

into an effective guerrilla force.

A second Roman expedition led by praetor
Varinius,

was ambushed while the officer bathed.

To elude the remaining Roman forces,

the rebels used their enemy’s corpses as
decoy guards,
stealing Varinius’s own horse
to aid their escape.

Thanks to his inspiring victories
and policy of distributing spoils equally,

Spartacus continued attracting followers,

and gained control of villages

where new weapons could be forged.

The Romans soon realized they were
no longer facing ragtag fugitives,

and in the spring of 72 BCE,

the Senate retaliated with
the full force of two legions.

The rebels left victorious,

but many lives were lost in the battle,

including Spartacus’ lieutenant Crixus.

To honor him,
Spartacus held funeral games,

forcing his Roman prisoners to play the
role his fellow rebels had once endured.
By the end of 72 BCE,

Spartacus’ army was a massive force of
roughly 120,000 members.

But those numbers proved
difficult to manage.

With the path to the Alps clear,

Spartacus wanted to march
beyond Rome’s borders,

where his followers would be free.

But his vast army had grown brash.

Many wanted to continue pillaging,

while others dreamed of
marching on Rome itself.

In the end, the rebel army turned south–

forgoing what would be their
last chance at freedom.

Meanwhile, Marcus Licinius Crassus
had assumed control of the war.

As Rome’s wealthiest citizen,

he pursued Spartacus
with eight new legions,
eventually trapping the rebels
in the toe of Italy.

After failed attempts to build rafts,

and a stinging betrayal by local pirates,
the rebels made a desperate run
to break through Crassus’s lines–

but it was no use.

Roman reinforcements were returning
from the Pontic wars,
and the rebels’ ranks and
spirits were broken.

In 71 BCE, they made their last stand.

Spartacus nearly managed to reach Crassus
before being cut down by centurions.
His army was destroyed,

and 6000 captives were crucified
along the Appian Way–

a haunting demonstration
of Roman authority.

Crassus won the war,

but it is not his legacy which echoes
through the centuries.

Thousands of years later,

the name of the slave who made the
world’s mightiest empire tremble

has become synonymous with freedom–

and the courage to fight for it.

﻿The annals of Ancient Egyptian king
Thutmose III

described a marvelous foreign bird that

“gives birth daily.”

Zoroastrians viewed them as spirits

whose cries told of the cosmic struggle
between darkness and light.

Romans brought them on
their military campaigns

to foretell the success of future battles.

And today, this bird still occupies
an important,

though much less honorable position

– on our dinner plates.

The modern chicken is descended
primarily from the Red Junglefowl,
and partially from three other
closely related species,

all native to India and Southeast Asia.

The region’s bamboo plants produce

massive amounts of fruit

just once every few decades.

Junglefowls’ ability to lay eggs daily

may have evolved to take advantage
of these rare feasts,

increasing their population
when food was abundant.

This was something humans could exploit
on a consistent basis,

and the birds’ weak flight capabilities

and limited need for space made them

easy to capture and contain.

The earliest domesticated chickens,

dating at least back to 7,000 years ago,
weren’t bred for food,

but for something considered
less savory today.

The aggressiveness of breeding males,

armed with natural leg spurs,

made cockfighting a popular entertainment.

By the second millennium BCE,

chickens had spread from the
Indus Valley to China

and the Middle East to occupy
royal menageries
and to be used in religious rituals.

But it was in Egypt

where the next chapter in
the bird’s history began.

When a hen naturally incubates eggs,

she will stop laying new ones
and sit on a “clutch” of 6
or more eggs for 21 days.

By the middle of the 1st millennium BCE,

the Egyptians had learned

to artificially incubate chicken eggs

by placing them in baskets over hot ashes.

That freed up hens to continue
laying daily,

and what had been a royal delicacy

or religious offering

became a common meal.

Around the same time as Egyptians
were incubating eggs,

Phoenician merchants introduced
chickens to Europe,

where they quickly became
an essential part

of European livestock.

However, for a long time,

the chicken’s revered status
continued to exist

alongside its culinary one.

The Ancient Greeks used fighting roosters

as inspirational examples
for young soldiers.

The Romans consulted chickens as oracles.
And as late as the 7th Century,

the chicken was considered
a symbol for Christianity.
Over the next few centuries,

chickens accompanied humans
wherever they went,

spreading throughout the world
through trade,

conquest,

and colonization.
After the Opium Wars,

Chinese breeds were brought to England

and crossed with local chickens.

This gave rise to a phenomenon called

“Hen Fever”
or “The Fancy”,

with farmers all over Europe

striving to breed new varieties

with particular combinations of traits.
This trend also caught the attention

of a certain Charles Darwin,
who wondered if

a similar selective breeding process
occurred in nature.

Darwin would observe hundreds of chickens

while finalizing his historic work
introducing the theory of Evolution.

But the chicken’s greatest
contribution to science

was yet to come.

In the early 20th century,

a trio of British scientists

conducted extensive crossbreeding
of chickens,

building on Gregor Mendel’s

studies of genetic inheritance.

With their high genetic diversity,

many distinct traits,
and only 7 months between generations,

chickens were the perfect subject.
This work resulted in the famous
Punnett Square,

used to show the genotypes
that would result

from breeding a given pairing.
Since then,

numerous breeding initiatives
have made chickens

bigger and meatier,

and allowed them to lay
more eggs than ever.

Meanwhile,

chicken production has shifted
to an industrial, factory-like model,

with birds raised in spaces
with a footprint

no larger than a sheet of paper.

And while there’s been a shift
towards free-range farming
due to animal rights
and environmental concerns,

most of the world’s more than
22 billion chickens today

are factory farmed.

From gladiators and gifts to the gods,

to traveling companions
and research subjects,

chickens have played many roles
over the centuries.

And though they may not have come
before the proverbial egg,
chickens’ fascinating history tells us
a great deal about our own.

﻿The year is 15 CE
and the Roman Empire is prospering.

Most of the credit will go to the emperor,

but this success wouldn’t
have been possible

without loyal soldiers like Servius Felix.

Servius enlisted as a legionary
eight years ago at age 18,

the son of a poor farmer
with few prospects.

Unlike the majority of legionaries,
he doesn’t gamble,

so he’s been able to save
most of his wages.

He’s even kept his viaticum,

the three gold coins he received
when he enlisted.

If he survives until retirement,
he’ll receive several acres of land.

And he’s grown rather fond
of a girl back home

whom he intends to marry.

But he’ll have to wait until he completes
his 25 years of service

before that can happen.

And the life of a legionary
is dangerous and grueling.

Today, Servius’s legion,
along with three others,

has undertaken a “great march”
of 30,000 Roman paces,

the equivalent of nearly 36 kilometers.

Servius’s armor and weapons,
including his gladius,

scutum,
and two pila,

weigh over 20 kilograms.

And that’s not counting his backpack,
or sarcina,

which contains food and all the tools
he needs to help build the camp –

spade,

saw,

pickaxe,
and basket.

Although Servius is exhausted,
he won’t sleep much tonight.
He’s been assigned the first watch,

which means looking after
the baggage animals

and keeping alert
against a possible ambush.

After he’s done, he lies awake,
dreading the day ahead,

which will force him
to recall his worst nightmare.
At dawn, Servius eats breakfast
with his seven tent companions.

They’re like a family, all bearing scars
from the battles they’ve fought together.

Servius is from Italia,

but his fellow soldiers hail
from all over the empire,

which stretches from Syria to Spain.

So they’re all far from home
in the northern land of Germania.

Servius’s legion
and three others with him today
are under the command of
Emperor Tiberius’s nephew Germanicus,

named for his father’s military successes
against the Germanic tribes.
Each legion has close to 5,000 men,

divided into cohorts of about 500,

further subdivided into centuries
of around 80-100 men.

Each century is commanded by a centurion.
An aquilifer, or eagle-bearer, marches at
the head of each legion

carrying its eagle standard.
The centurions march beside
the legionaries belting out orders,

“Dex, sin, dex, sin,"

“Right, left, right, left,"

starting with the right foot as the left
is considered unlucky or sinister.

Despite the strict discipline,
there’s tension in the air.
Last year, some legions
in the area revolted,

demanding better pay
and a cut in the length of service.

Only their general’s charisma
and negotiating skills

prevented wholesale mutiny.

Today is a “just march,”
only 30 kilometers.

As the marshes and forests of Germania
lie beyond the empire’s road system
the men must build causeways
and bridges to make headway—

something they’ve recently spent
more time doing than fighting.

Finally, they arrive at their destination,
a place Servius knows too well.

It’s a clearing on the outskirts
of the Teutoburg Forest,

where six years ago, during the
reign of the Emperor Augustus,

Germanic tribes under
their chieftain Arminius
ambushed and destroyed three legions.

Proceeding along a narrow path,
the legions were attacked from
forest cover under torrential rain

with their escape blocked.

It was one of the worst defeats
the Romans ever suffered

and Augustus never lived it down.

Servius was one of the few survivors.
Servius still has nightmares of
his comrades lying where they fell.

But now the army is back to bury
the dead with full military honors.

As he helps in the task,
he can’t help wondering whether the bones
he handles belonged to someone he knew.

Several times he wants to weep aloud,
but he pushes on with the task.

The glory of the Empire
can go to the crows.

All he craves is to retire
on a small farm with his wife-to-be,

if the gods should spare his life
for 17 more years.
